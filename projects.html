        <h2>Fly Fishing Company Database Design and Implementation</h2>
        <h3>MIS3353 Databases - University of Oklahoma</h3>
        <p>
            For this project, we collaborated as a team to act as database consultants for a fly fishing company. Our professor played the role of the client, providing us with initial requirements and use cases. We began by interviewing the client to clarify their needs, enabling us to design a database tailored to their business processes. Using LucidChart, we created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and normalized the database structure to ensure efficiency and eliminate redundancy.

Through logical design, we transformed the conceptual model into a fully functional database, which we implemented in Microsoft SQL Server. Thousands of data records were generated and inserted into the database to simulate real-world operations. We also crafted and executed dozens of SQL queries to extract meaningful insights, test the database's performance, and demonstrate its utility.

Our efforts resulted in a comprehensive PDF report documenting the entire process—including the ERD, normalization steps, queries, results, and access instructions—which earned us a perfect score of 100%. This project showcases our ability to engage with clients, analyze requirements, design efficient databases, and deliver a solution that exceeds expectations.

        <h2>Love's Travel Stops Data Analysis</h2>
        <h3>MIS3213 Business Data Analysis - University of Oklahoma</h3>
        <p>
            This ongoing project is a collaboration between the University of Oklahoma Price College of Business MIS Department and Love's Travel Stops. My team and I have been provided with extensive data regarding Love's loyalty program, drivers, and monthly campaigns. Alongside these datasets, we were given specific business questions and objectives to guide our analysis.

            I was selected as the team leader and have coordinated efforts to manipulate and filter through the data using Python, uncovering insights and trends. We are also leveraging PowerBI to create visualizations that communicate our findings effectively. The project is still in progress, and we are continuously refining our analysis to address the key business questions provided by Love's.
