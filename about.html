    <!-- About Me Section -->
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I am a third-year student at the University of Oklahoma, pursuing an accelerated dual-degree program to earn a Bachelor of Business Administration in Management Information Systems and a Master of Science in Management Information Technology by May 2026. My academic journey has equipped me with skills in programming languages and tools such as Python, C#, SQL, Power BI, and MongoDB. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of academics, I actively manage a reselling business, collaborating with clients and honing my business and data analytics skills. This entrepreneurial experience has complemented my interests in consulting and problem-solving. Additionally, my background includes working with coworkers and customers in diverse roles, which has strengthened my ability to build relationships and maintain composure in high-pressure situations.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am passionate about fitness, data-driven decision-making, and roles that combine technology with human interaction. I am particularly excited about opportunities in technical account management and consulting, where I can leverage my technical expertise and interpersonal skills to create meaningful solutions.
